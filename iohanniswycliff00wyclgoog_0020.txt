legem snam, per instinctam et casns qzcas immittit aa'
partem colinariam, qais dictitat qnin citationi dann'ni est
parandam? In excusing himself in 1384 from obedience
to a citation of Urban VI, Wyclif was to use language
very similar to this, but here it is difficult not to see a
reference to his conditional citation in the bulls of May,
1377, which the death of Gregory XI in the following
March rendered inoperative.

One more reference to current events remains for con-
sideration, and that the most important. It occurs in
Chapter 11, and is an unmistakable allusion to the papal
schism which was plotted in July‚ 1378, and consummated
by the election of Clement VII as anti-Pope on the
twentieth of the following September. Veritas has been
speaking of the too great reverence paid to papal decisionS‚
and adds, as an example of the popular folly, Et si dno
pape aa seminatione sathane electi fnen'nt, papali diversi
elacn'anes illas approbant tanquam fidem. Et ex tali scis·
mata on'nipossent inconveniencia infinita. The allusion is
made the more pointed by the attack which follows on the
method of election by cardinals instead of by lot, for the
ground on which it was sought to invalidate the election
of Urban was that the cardinals had been so intimidated
by the clamour of the populace fora Roman pope, that

- they had made their choice against the guiding of the

Holy Spirit. It is unfortunate that a passage of so
much importance is not altogether free from difficulties
of interpretation. If the reading possent is right, and
the tense is to be pressed, it might be held to point to a
date such as September, 1378, when the subject was
already under discussion, but the news of the election of
Clement had not yet reached England. It is more
‘probable however, that we ought to read pussant,
especially as the words papali diversi electiones illas
approbant tanqnarn fidem would be more forcible after
than before the recognition of Clement by the University

of Paris, which did not take place till the spring of 1379. Ι
