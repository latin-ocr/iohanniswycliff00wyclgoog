On paper. 4to. Handwriting 01 the first 1101101 the
15th century. Initials in red. With catchwords, also
glosses, both in the text and on the margin. Contents
as in 3930. Α1 end the word Pliaczka, then in another
hand the same colophon and gloss as in 4505 and 4515,
but with the name written Wlikeff. At the end 01 1110
Gloss: A nakonczy Palicka prziekel.

According to Dr. Herzberg-Fr'ankel the relations 01
these MSS. are as follows. The Ashburnham MS. stands
by 113011, with important differences from all the others.
The eight Vienna MSS. 1011 into two head-groups, 01

which the first comprises 3930 and 1387, and the second
the other six. This second group rnay be further sub-
divided into two groupS, each 01 three manuscripts. To
the first sub-group belong 1622, 1338, and 43023 to the
second 4515, 4536, and 4505. The Vienna manuscript
which approaches most nearly to the Ashburnham is

3930, butthis has been corrected in another hand from ¹

one os the manuscripts 01 the 4505 sub-group. Halt-
way between this sub-group and the Ashburnham stands
1387, but more nearly related to the former.

The text os the present edition is taken from Lord
Ashbumham’s manuscript, transcribed some years ago by
Mr. Matthew, and collated by myseli. For the portion 01
Chapter 30 omitted 111 this manuscript, and 101 the Epilo-

by Dr. Herzberg·Fr'anl<el. Dr. Herzberg·Fr'ankel has also
supplied the materials 101 the collation 01 our text with
those 013930, 1387, 4505, and in the Epilogus, 1338. As
regards these manuscripts I have to express my regret
101 having thoughtlessly relettered them in the order 01
their relation to the Ashburnham manuscript, instead 01
having adopted the letters used 101 them by Dr. Bud-
densieg in his edition 01 the Latin Polemical Works.
As to the principle on which I have printed the text,
I am glad to say that Ι found the Ashburnham manu-
