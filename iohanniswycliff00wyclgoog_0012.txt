no concessions of His tenants, the temporal lordS, can
hold good; and the example of popes goes for nothing

unless founded on reason and Scripture. The only course
ior the clergy is contrition and'restitution.

Already Mendacium has shown a disposition to avoid
the test of Scriptum, and he now begins a series of what
I have roughly called appeals to Church authority. His
main position is that endowments are supported by the
lives of the saints, but when Veritas sets up against
this the doctrine that the Scripture alone is binding,
papal bulls, indulgences and letters of bishops and of

do harm, and would be better addressed directly to God.
This Mendacium considers as a failure of reverence to
men whose sanctity has been approved by canonization
and miracles, and Veritas is thus given an excuse for
attacking more abuseS, while the further objections of
Mendacium that disendowment would lessen the numbers
of the clergy, and that prelates who rank as great nobles

of the prayers by the sale of which the vast revenues
of the monasteries were mainly obtained. Mendacium
introduces the subject by the objection that, it endow-
