while in 1387 it is more likely that the lacuna should be
supplied from the Appendix than by Chapter 31, of
which noue of the Viennese MSS. have any trace what·
ever. Itis remarkable, however, how many difficulties
the last thirty pages of the Dialogus present compared
with the smoothness of what has gone before. We have
first one chapter which only exists in a single manu-
script 3 then another which is only given by four out of
nine, and the place of which in these four is quite unex-
plainable3 then a total abandonment of the Dialogue
form3 lastly, an Epilogus which is not, as it professes to
be, merely a summary of the preceding arguments, but
a fresh treatment of the subject, though on similar lines
Is it possible that there were two editions of the Dialogus,
of which the first may be represented by the Vienna
MSS. which have no Appendix‚ while the second con-
tained new chapters not very artistically dovetailed into

the earlier text? Such an hypothesis may perhaps ·

compete with that of the scribe of 1338, who attributes
the usual omission of the Appendix to the work of
‘false brothers.>

In preparing this edition of the Dialogus Ι have in·
curred heavy debts of gratitude to several kind helpers.
Iwould again allude to the great courtesy of the Earl
of Ashburnham in allowing me the use of his manu-
scripts to correct proofs with, after it had already been
transcribed. To Mr. R. L. Poole I owe my thanks for
advice on the verifying of quotationS, a field in which
the best I could do compares but poorly with his own
untiring energy. To Dr. Furnivall I am grateful for
much cheery encouragement‚ and the most considerate
patience with a very slow editor. But the debt which
I am least able adequately to acknowledge is that with
which Mr. F. D. Matthew has burdened me by his most
generously given help, in pointing out errors of the
press, in suggesting improvements in the analysis and
in aiding me with his most carefully considered advice
