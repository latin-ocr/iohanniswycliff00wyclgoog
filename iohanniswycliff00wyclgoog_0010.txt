us, the Speculum Ecclesia Militantis is written in the
form of a dialogue. Later on, in the T rialogus, Wyclif
was to show that he had attained at least a moderate
mastery over the difficulties of this kind of composition,
but the Dialogus was his first essay in it, and from a
literary point of view is open to some criticism. The
persons of the dialogue are Veritas and Mendacium, and
at the outset we are told (on the authority of John xiv. 6,
and viii. 44) that the first of these stands for Christ, and
the second for the Devil. In the first three chapters
some attempt is made to adhere to this characterization,
and we have such sentences as ‘ Cain ega siai deris conditor
casiaslibet creatura’ ‘ordinavi illis regulas vivendi,' ‘ faci
illam scribi iii duplici testameiita,’ though side by side
with thern are others in which Christ is spoken of in
the third person. After Chapter 3 Veritas is Wyclif,
and Wyclif only, and we have him frequently professing
the purity of his motives and his readiness to confront
the Pope, or to endure persecution for the truth. As
to Mendacium, there is no attempt at characterization
whatever. He is only a rather simple upholder of exist-
ing abiises, and is content to use such very Wyclifite
language as atpatet a'a heresi ia ariclarislia at aliis sirni-
libas qua ia fiae tainparam diabolas spissius seminavit.
A further literary defect may be noted in the length at
which Veritas sometimes soliloquizes His opening
statement occupies fourteen pages, and though Men-
dacium is allowed in all twenty short paragraphs‚ the
last three speeches by Veritas fill respectively nine, four,
and eleven pages¹.

The Dialogus does not lend itself very easily to division
into sectionS, but we may group its thirty-six chapters
under five fairly distinct heads. Thus 1-10 contain the

appearance os having been originally written without any reference to

‹glalaogue form,6and this is still more strongly the case if we look only to
pters 32-3·
