in Wyclif’s teaching as to the constitution ol the Church.
The same, I think, may be said ol what we find written
on other points. Thus an attack is made on the exercise
lor gain ol the three distinctively episcopal functions ol
confirmation, ordination, and consecration ol places (p. 50,
l. 19), but it is not yet suggested that these can be
exercisetl by any priest. Again, as to the endowment of
the Church‚ the main subject of the treatise. Wyclil
here teaches that all property held in direct ownership
must be surrendered, but though his arguments tend in
the direction of the abolition ol times, his language on
the subject is not so decided as in later works. That
he attacks the monastic system with bitterness helps as
nothing, lor this was part of his earliest teaching, and his
virulence on this point is in strong contrast with the corn-
paratively moderate language about the Friars which we
have next to consider. As to this it must be noted that
the theory that Wyclif was friendly to the Mendicant
Orders till the end ol 1381 has been decisively disproved
by Mr. Matthew. ln the tract De Officio Pastorali
(which both in its Latin and English versions alludes to
Avignon as the residence of the Pope, which it had ceased
to be after Gregory XI’s triumphant entry into Rome in
1377) Wyclil is already using strong expressions against
the Friars. Indeed, if it were not that he seems, until
quite the end os his lile, to have been much more
moderate on this subject in his Latin than in his English
writings, it would be difficult to explain how his language
in the Dialogus is as temperate as it actually is.- At
the end of Chapter 30, and ina few other places, we have
single passages more or less strongly condemnatory of
them¹‚ but, as Ι have already observed‚ Chapter 19, ol
whlch they form the subject, is remarkable lor the
moderation oi its language. This chapter, taken with
the reference to them on p. 85, as likely to support
the duty ol poverty, suggests that the Dialogus was
