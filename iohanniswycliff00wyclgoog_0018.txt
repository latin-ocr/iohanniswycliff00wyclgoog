current events,we have first an important piece of negative
evidence. F ew events stirred Wyclif more deeply than
Bishop Spencer’s crusade in Flanders, and his allusions
to it in his latest writings are so frequent that it is im-
possible to believe that, in a work of the length of the
Dialogus, it would have been unnoticed had it occurred.
This is the more certain because the bearing of arms by
the clergy is actually mentioned in Chapter4 (p. 8, l. 6),
where a reference to the crusade would have been very
apposite. In the absence of such reference we may
safely conclude that our treatise was composed not later
than 1382. Was it composed in 1382? This date is
supported by the great authority of Dr. Lechler1‚ and it
has in its favour a passage at the end of Chapter 5, where,
after speaking of the increase of simony‚ Veritas pro-
ceeds: Per lroc autern irrleabiles aspirant ud superiores
gradus sacerdocii et impediunt verbum dei predicari in
populo, et anhelantes ud illud lurrqnuru hereticos perse-

cuntur: et ista persecucio esl heresis sue rnanifesturu in- ’

dicium ,· uec srffciunt pauperes etpanci fideles sacerdotes
resistere, uisi dens per seculare braclriurn vel aliunde cr'cins
munaus apposuerit areJulrices (p. 10, l. 23 sqq.). At first
sight this appears to be a clear reference to the appoint-
ment of Wyclifs old enemy, Courtenay, to be Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, and to those measures against the
‘Poor Priests' which were almost his first official acts.
Anyone who holds that the date 1382 is plausible on
other grounds has a right to regard this passage as a
strong confirmation of his view: it must, however, be
remarked (1) that there is no ground for asserting that

Council, May 21.—Edict against Poor Priests, May 26.—Attack on Wyclitites
at 0xford, May-November.—Bull for the crusade against Clement corn·
municated to Parliament, November.—The translation of the Bible was
probably completed this year.

his edition of the Trialogus.
